Installation
============

Windows
-------
For Windows, binary installer is provided (both 32-bit and 64-bit). However,
you can build the sources by your own if you want (see "Linux" section).
The code is compatible with MSVS 2010 and MinGW.

Linux and Mac OS X
------------------
"Sibelia" is distributed in sources. It requires two things to be built:
1) CMake
2) GCC C++ compiler (version 4.2.0+ works fine)

To install the program, type following:

cd build
cmake ../src
make install

If you want to install "Sibelia" to a location other than /usr/local/bin, run
CMake with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option set:

cmake ../src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<install destination>"
