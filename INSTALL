Installation
============

Windows
-------
For Windows, binary installer is provided (both 32-bit and 64-bit). However,
you can build the sources by your own if you want (see "Linux" section). 
Although the source code is compatible with MSVS 2010, we STRONGLY recommend
you to use CMake + MinGW or CMake + MSYS for this.

Linux and Mac OS X
------------------
"Sibelia" is distributed in sources. It requires two things to be built:
1) CMake
2) GCC C++ compiler (version 4.2.0+ works fine)

To build the project, type following:

cd build
cmake ../src
make

After that you will get executable file "Sibelia".
