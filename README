Introduction
============
"SyntenyFinder" is a tool for finding synteny blocks (regions of conserved DNA)
in closely related genomes, like different strains of the same bacterial
specie. It takes a set of FASTA files with genomes and locates coordinates of
the synteny blocks in these sequences.

System Requirements
===================
This version is designed for small-scale genomes. For example, it can find
synteny blocks in 8 bacterial genomes (50 MB of genomic data) in ~45 minutes
and using 3 GB of RAM on an Intel i5 laptop. Next versions will be faster and
require less memory.

Installation
============

Windows
------------
For Windows, binary installer is provided (both 32-bit and 64-bit). However,
you can build the sources by your own if you want (see "Linux" section). 
Source code is compatible with MSVS 2010.

Linux
------------
"SyntenyFinder" is distributed in sources. It requires two things to be built:
1) CMake
2) GCC C++ compiler (version 4.4.6 works fine)

To build the project, type following:

cd build
cmake ../src
make

After that you will get executable file "SyntenyFinder".

Usage
=====

Basic usage
-----------
"SyntenyFinder" takes a set of FASTA files as input. Each file can contain
multiple sequences. Easiest way to run the tool is to type:

SyntenyFinder -s loose <input FASTA file(s)>

"Build" directory already contains file with two small bacterial genomes in
the file "tiny.fasta". To run SyntenyFinder on this file, just type:

SyntenyFinder -s loose tiny.fasta

The program also has some parameters that can be set. To see all possible
parameters, type:

SyntenyFinder -h

Detailed description of the parameters can be found in file "USAGE".

Output description
------------------
By default, "SyntenyFinder produces 3 output files. Designations of these files
are described below. 

1) block_coords.txt - coordinates of the synteny blocks in simple, 
human-readable format
2) coverage_report.txt - reports percentage of the genomes that found synteny
blocks cover     
3) genomes_permutations.txt - input genomes represented as permutations of the
synteny blocks

The program also can produce additional output files (blocks' sequences
for example). For more information see file "USAGE" located in the root
directory.
