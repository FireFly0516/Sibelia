Introduction
============
SyntenyFinder is a tool for finding synteny blocks (regions of conserved DNA)
in closely related genomes, like different strains of the same bacterial
specie. It takes a FASTA file with sequences and locates coordinates of
the synteny blocks in these genomes.

System Requirements
===================
This version is designed for small-scale genomes. For example, it can find
synteny blocks in 8 bacterial genomes (50 MB of genomic data) in ~45 minutes
and using 3 GB of RAM on an Intel i5 laptop. Next versions will be faster and
require less memory.

Installation
============

Windows
------------
For Windows, binary installer is provided (both 32-bit and 64-bit). However,
you can build the sources by your own if you want (see "Linux" section). 
Source code is compatible with MSVS 2010.

Linux
------------
SyntenyFinder is distributed in sources. It requires two things to be built:
1) CMake
2) GCC C++ compiler (version 4.4.6 works fine)

To build the project, type following:

cd build
cmake ../src
make

After that you will get executable file "SyntenyFinder".

Usage
=====

Input
-----
SyntenyFinder takes a single FASTA file as input. This file can contain
multiple sequences. To run the program just type:

SyntenyFinder <input FASTA file>

"Build" directory already contains file with two small bacterial genomes in
the file "tiny.fasta". To run SyntenyFinder on this file, just type:

SyntenyFinder tiny.fasta

<Here will be detailed description of a rich set of command-line parameters>

Output
------
SyntenyFinder produces 4 output files. Each file has name INPUT_FILE + SUFFIX.
<Of course, this will be changed very soon>
Designations of these files are described below. 

Suffix      Content

_chr        Input genomes represented as permutations of the synteny blocks
_indices    Coordinates of the synteny blocks
_blocks     Coordinates of the blocks and sequences of the blocks
_report     Reports percentage of the genomes that found synteny blocks cover

More detailed description can be found in file OUTPUT located in the root
directory.
