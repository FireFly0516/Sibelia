Introduction
============
"Sibelia" is a tool for finding synteny blocks (regions of conserved DNA)
in closely related genomes, like different strains of the same bacterial
specie. It takes a set of FASTA files with genomes and locates coordinates of
the synteny blocks in these sequences.

System Requirements
===================
This version is designed for small-scale genomes. For example, it can find
synteny blocks in 8 bacterial genomes (50 MB of genomic data) in ~35 minutes
and using 2.5 GB of RAM on an Intel i5 laptop. Next versions will be faster and
require less memory.

Installation
============
See INSTALL.

Usage
=====
