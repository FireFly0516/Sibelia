Basic usage
===========
The easiest way to run "SyntenyFinder" is to type:

SyntenyFinder -s loose <input FASTA file(s)>

For example:

SyntenyFinder -s loose tiny.fasta

It will run "SyntenyFinder" on the file "tiny.fasta" with the "loose" 
simplification parameters. There is another simplification parameters set, 
called "fine". To run "SyntenyFinder" on "tiny.fasta" with "fine" parameters
set, type:

SyntenyFinder -s fine tiny.fasta

The differenece between "loose" and "fine" set is that "loose" usually
produces fewer blocks, but longer. And it can lose some small synteny
blocks (< 5000 BP), while "fine" option produces more blocks (but shorter)
and their coverage is worse. Usually "loose" is the best choice, but if
you do not want to lose information about small-scale rearrangaments,
use "fine". You also can set simplification parameters manually 
(see section "Fine tuning").

Fine tuning
===========
<This section will describe "physical meaning" of the parameters and how to
choose them manually>
