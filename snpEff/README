The script annotate.py is designed for variant annotation and effect prediction
for variants found by C-Sibelia. It can be launched without arguments from
directory with C-Sibelia results:
	
	annotate.py

If you want to specify your own vcf file as input for this tool, type:

	annotate.py -i variants.vcf

By default, name of annotated vcf is variant_ann.vcf. You can specify
other name with -o option. For example:
	
	annotate.py -i variants.vcf -o annotated.vcf
	
Take into account, that by default, script uses ##assembly field from vcf file
to get NCBI database name. For example, a possible value of this field can be
"##assembly=gi|57116681|ref|NC_000962.2|". 

One more important note about vcf is that #CHROM column must contain cromosome
name exactly the same as in snpEff database. For assembly name above it will be
"NC_000962".

If you wish, you can specify snpEff database name with the "--db" argument. 
Possible database names could be got by the command:

	java -jar snpEff.jar databases
