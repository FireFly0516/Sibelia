annotate.py is a script for variant annotation and effect prediction for synteny blocks found by C-Sibelia

It can be launched without arguments from directory with C-Sibelia results:
	
	annotate.py

If you want to specify your own vcf file as input for this tool, type:

	annotate.py -i variants.vcf

By default, name of annotated vcf is variant_ann.vcf. You can specify other name with -o option

For example:
	
	annotate.py -i variants.vcf -o annotated.vcf
	
Take into account, that by default, script uses ##assembly field from vcf file to get NCBI database name. Possible value of this field can be "##assembly=gi|57116681|ref|NC_000962.2|". 

One more important note about vcf is that #CHROM column must contain cromosome name exactly the same as in snpEff database. For assembly name above it will be "NC_000962".

If you wish, you can specify snpEff database name with --db argument. Possible database names can be get by command:

	java -jar snpEff.jar databases
