This folder contains auxiliary scripts for postprocessing Sibelia output.

sortsequences.py
----------------
This script performs sorting of sequences to minimize links crossing on circos
pictures. In order to use it, you must install the "circos helper tools":

	http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/utilities

You must specify path to the folder, generated by "Sibelia" and path to the
"orderchr" script from the "helper tools". After it's running it generates
a config where chromosomes are ordered. By default the config is written in:
	
	<Sibelia generated files>/circos/sorted.circos.conf

If you want to generate the picture with ordered chromosomes, you should run
circos with "--conf" option set.

hidemappedcontigs.py
--------------------
This script generates "circos" configuration files for pictures showing only
imperfectly mapped contigs when comparing assemblies. It also takes a path
to "Sibelia" output and a path to FASTA file with reference. After run, the
"circos" folder will contain config "unmapped.circos.conf" which generates
pictures containing only rearranged contigs. Also for each such sequence a
config "seq<N>.circos.conf" is written in the same directory.
